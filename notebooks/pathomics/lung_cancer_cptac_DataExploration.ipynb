        "# IDC Tutorial: Data exploration of slide microscopy images\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to explore slide microscopy data using the [Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/).\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides radiology, slide microscopy is the second major imaging modality in the IDC. Slide microscopy images show thin sections of tissue samples (e.g., from a resected tumor) at microscopic resolution. They provide a unique glimpse into cellular architecture and function that is essential for diagnosing complex diseases like cancer. Computerized analysis makes the assessment of slide microscopy images more reproducible and less time consuming and it enables the extration of novel digital biomarkers from tissue images.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial provides a **5-minute** introduction to the way slide microscopy data is organized within the IDC and demonstrates how to examine available data and build a data set for further analysis. For a more comprehensive tutorial including training of a tissue classification model on IDC-hosted slide microscopy data, see [here](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/idc-comppath-reproducibility).  \n",
