However, such data is most often stored in spreadsheets that follow conventions specific to the site that collected the data, may not be accompanied by the dictionary defining the terms used in describing clinical data, and is rarely harmonized. As an example, you can consider examing the clinical data that accompanies the [ACRIN 6698 collection](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=50135447) curated by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). File named \"Full Ancillary Patient Information file.xlsx\" linked from the collection page contains two sheets, one of which is the dictionary, and the othe one contains per-patient data with the columns defined by the dictionary.\n",
