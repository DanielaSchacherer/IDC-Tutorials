This repository contains a series of examples to get you started using the data and tools provided by the Imaging Data Commons on the Google Cloud Platform.

* **[API](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/tree/master/API)**: this directory contains example scripts that illustrate the use of the IDC API;
* **[notebooks](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/tree/master/notebooks)**: this directory (will) contains tutorials in the form of IPython notebooks;
### Important note on notebooks
If you launch your own Cloud Datalab instance, please be sure to shut it down when you are no longer using it.  A typical Google Cloud Datalab VM will cost your project approximately **$1/day**.  Shut down instructions and other tips are [here](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/getting-started) -- look for the section called **Stopping/Starting VM Instances**.
